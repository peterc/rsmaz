* http://github.com/peterc/rsmaz/tree/master (original Ruby version)
* http://github.com/antirez/smaz/tree/master (original C version)

== DESCRIPTION:

Short String Compression for Ruby. (This fork was made to get the parent rsmaz gem working on Ruby 3.2.1, more specifically to handle the deprecation of the Fixnum class)

RSmaz is a pure-Ruby port of the Smaz short string compression
algorithm by Salvatore Sanfilippo and released as a C library at:
http://github.com/antirez/smaz/tree/master

I've done some initial cleanup of a pure Ruby->C port, but this
is not yet complete. It does pass the specs, however! Feel free
to clean it up as it's a bit memory inefficient right now... :)

== REQUIREMENTS:

* Ruby 3.2.1 or higher and MiniTest

== INSTALLATION:

  Add the following line to your Gemfile:
  ```
    gem 'rsmaz', git: 'https://github.com/abletech/rsmaz'
  ```
  Then run `bundle install`

== USAGE:

  require 'rsmaz'
  r = RSmaz.compress("whatever")
  puts RSmaz.decompress(r)

=== Ruby 1.9 and encodings

RSmaz.compress always returns a string with the binary encoding. The
input can be any encoding, it will internally force it to binary
and compress byte-by-byte.

RSmaz.decompress also always returns a string with the binary encoding.
You must manually force the encoding back to the right one because
RSmaz does not store information about the original encoding.
